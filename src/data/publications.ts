    type: 'research-paper',
    publisher: 'IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security',
    publishedDate: '2023-11-15',
    description: 'Comprehensive research on implementing machine learning algorithms for detecting advanced persistent threats in enterprise network environments.',
    abstract: 'This paper presents a novel approach to real-time cyber threat detection using ensemble machine learning techniques. We propose a hybrid model combining deep neural networks with traditional anomaly detection methods to identify sophisticated attack patterns in network traffic. Our experimental results demonstrate a 97.3% detection accuracy with a false positive rate of less than 0.5%. The system was tested on a dataset of 10 million network flows collected from enterprise environments over 12 months.',
